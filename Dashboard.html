                            <br>I was deeply involved in silat, the traditional Indonesian martial art, and achieved the rank of green belt. My dedication and hard work in this discipline paid off as I successfully competed and won in several competitions, reaching the district level.

                            <br>I was also an active member of the student organization, where I took on the role of fundraising coordinator. In this capacity, I organized and managed fundraising activities, successfully raising 7 million IDR for our school's event, GOJAKO-DAY. This experience taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and financial management.

                            <br>In addition to my involvement in silat and student organizations, I was a member of the school's basketball team. Participating in basketball helped me develop teamwork skills, discipline, and a strong sense of sportsmanship.
